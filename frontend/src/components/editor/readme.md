            <Slate> is the CONTEXT PROVIDER
            
            What it does:
            - Makes 'editor' available to all child components
            - Like a "brain" that everyone can access
            - Must wrap <Editable> and any custom toolbar components
            
            Props:
            - editor: the editor instance we created
            - initialValue: starting document (only used on mount)
            - onValueChange: called when document changes

    onClick :- Fires after mouse is pressed and released

# Keydown events.
    keydown:- Whenever we presses the key, the event got fired so holding a key means event lp
